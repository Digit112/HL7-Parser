# HL7 2.5 Notes

The following notes of mine are quotes & thoughts on the HL7 2.5 specification retrieved from https://www.hl7.eu/HL7v2x/v25/std25/ch02.html.

### § 2.3.2 Acknowledgements: original mode

> ... it is not sufficient to know that the underlying communications system guaranteed delivery of the message. It is also necessary to know that the receiving application processed the data successfully at a logical application level ... The HL7 Standard makes no assumptions about the ownership of data. ... All that is required is that the receiving system accept responsibility for the data, providing the same integrity test that it would apply to data from any source.

### § 2.3.3 Acknowledgements: enhanced mode

> With a positive accept acknowledgment, the receiving system commits the message to safe storage in a manner that releases the sending system from the need to resend the message.

### § 2.5.3 Fields

> The difference appears when the contents of a message will be used to update a record in a database rather than create a new one. If no value is sent, (i.e., it is omitted) the old value should remain unchanged. If the null value is sent, the old value should be changed to null
