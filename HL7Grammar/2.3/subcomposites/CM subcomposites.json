The first component is the message type edited by HL7 table 0076 - Message type; second is the trigger event code edited by HL7 table 0003 - Event type. The receiving system uses this field to know the data segments to recognize, and possibly, the application to which to route this message. For certain queries, which may have more than a single response event type, the second component may, in the response message, vary to indicate the response event type. See the discussion of the display query variants in Section 2.17.1.1, \"Original mode display query variants.\" The second component is not required on response or acknowledgment messages.",
